# SSH passwordless login
This idea comes to my mind because I can not remember my passwords on servers so I decided to write this script.  

# Installation
```
sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amirsasani/ssh-passwordless/main/ssh-passwordless.sh -o /usr/local/bin/ssh-passwordless
sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/ssh-passwordless
```
# Usage
just run `ssh-passwordless` in your terminal :)
